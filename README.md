# Mount-Moses-Observatory
ABSTRACT

Mount Moses Observatory is the name given to projected globally scattered high altitude ground based scientific research stations and solution-oriented product development and distribution studios through which future descendants of locally initialized developers can interact and trade with each other and with surface communities while working in subterranean environments. Teams of intellectuals, interns and artisans are currently involved in an online collaborate effort to kick-start the project. Upon fruition, the resultant system is expected to supply material and social requirements for supporting the fourth industrial revolution and subsequent fulfillment of friendly global goals. A pilot ground station is currently under development in Nyamira, Kenya. This paper describes how the project can be put together and maneuvered to success.
