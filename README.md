# Mount-Moses-Observatory
ABSTRACT

Mount Moses Observatory is the name given to projected globally scattered high altitude ground based scientific research stations and solution-oriented product development and distribution studios through which future descendants of locally initialized developers can interact and trade with each other and with surface communities while working in subterranean environments. Teams of intellectuals, interns and artisans are currently involved in an online collaborate effort to kick-start the project. Upon fruition, the resultant system is expected to supply material and social requirements for supporting the fourth industrial revolution and subsequent fulfillment of friendly global goals. A pilot ground station is currently under development in Nyamira, Kenya. This paper describes how the project can be put together and maneuvered to success.

Design and Implementation of Conditional Standing Orders Agency (CSOA) Application for Kenyan Banking and other financial Institutions

Problem Statement: Automated Remuneration

In Kenya, when standing orders are enforced by banks to pay institutions periodically the following happens:

Case1 - Insurance:

In the case of insurance companies, premiums are usually deducted from the balance periodically e.g. monthly. Usually these instructions are executed on a given date e.g. every month on 5th and can be automated. However, the problem arises when an individual’s bank balance is lower than the amount of the standing order at the moment of order execution. This is mainly because many people find it difficult to monitor bank balances so that they may have required balances on material dates. Bank fines have been rampant and people have continued to suffer unfair losses. Banks have persisted in claiming the fines as an additional source of revenue and their profits have been huge. But this is not fair business to the clients at all. As a matter of fact, it may be described as exploitation of financial technology armateurs.

Case 2 - Converting employees to subsequent employers:

Many people in the world today seek employment because they want to generate capital for financing their business or research-related business. However, due to the artisanal nature of African industry, many entrepreneurs are disconnected from corporate finance. This is clearly illustrated online by large-scale adoption of informal social communication media like whatsapp and facebook by majority of enterprising Africans whereas the corporate is locked up on linkedin and email. A common meeting point of people from these two worlds is telephone conversation.

If for example, government employees can access facilities that allow them to pay artisanal contractors through reliable standing orders, which deduct from their salary accounts, many problems in the current financial system can be eliminated.
